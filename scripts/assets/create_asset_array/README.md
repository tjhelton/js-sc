# Create Asset Array

The purpose of this script is to create an array of unarchived asset IDs from a SafetyCulture environment. This script is part of a randomization effort for demos.

## Set up:

Ensure dependencies are installed by running the below command in the directory of the script:

```bash
npm i
```

Create a .env file with a `TOKEN` parameter as follows:

```bash
TOKEN=5b1d73376dhy2a92960a0171b...
```

## Running the script:

Once the set up is complete, run the following command in a terminal:
`node index.mjs`

## Outputs:

The script will generate an `assets.json` array that can be used in randomization.
