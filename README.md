# Node.js Scripts for Customer Success Engineers

## Description
Welcome to the sharingan repository. These scripts are designed to help Customer Success Engineers interact with the SafetyCulture API, either for internal support or customers. Whether you're new to the team or looking to refine your skills, this repository offers valuable resources to get you started with automating.

This repository will mostly utilize nodeJS (because we are raised by web developers), but feel free to utilize programming langagues you are comfortable in. In those cases, please consider limitations that may be present when someone wishes to utilize your scripts (virtual environments, etc.) and provide exceptional documentation.
